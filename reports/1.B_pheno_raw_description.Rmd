## R Markdown

"1_QTL_AllFamilies_NoOutlier"

This is QTL phenotypic data for all field plots, before averaging reps.
Factors for BLUP: Longitude = plot column. Latitude = plot row. TFamily = F1/inbred/control grouping. Line is alternative name for Genotype. Rep (1 vs 2)

Phenotype Key: SC = stand count, DT = days to tassel, DPS = days to pollen shed, 15NT1 = 15N sample time-point 1, 15NT2 = 15N time-point 2, 15NT3 = 15N time-point 3, AR = aerial root nodes, PDM = plant dry mass, PTN = plant total nitrogen, GDM = grain dry mass, GTN = grain total nitrogen. 15NT_R values can be ignored.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
